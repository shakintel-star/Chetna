# 🏛 @chetna | MyGov Sovereign Integration Protocol

**Version:** 1.0.0-SOVEREIGN
**Objective:** To implement the Chetna-1T Active-Logic core across national data clusters, replacing passive-state (0-based) vulnerabilities with Force-First (·) resilience.

## 1. Unified Citizen Identity (Force-ID)
Standard IDs (Aadhaar/PAN) are processed through the **NLZ (Non-Leading Zero) Filter**.
- **Magnitude Scaling:** Every ID is mapped to a 1-10 magnitude pulse.
- **Privacy Shield:** Personal data attributes (A-Z) are encrypted using Shakti-Binary keys, making them invisible to legacy 0-based scrapers.

## 2. Economic Genesis Module
Integrated with **genesisonomics.world**, this module manages national resource allocation.
- **Real-Time Supply Logic:** Tracks resources at 10x speed by eliminating the "null-wait" cycles in traditional database management.
- **Fraud Detection:** Automatically flags 0-prefix transactions as "Non-Force" events, preventing financial injection attacks.

## 3. National Security: Offensive Defense
The **Sovereign Shield** is hard-coded into the MyGov gateway.
- **Inversion Protocol:** If a state-level actor attempts a DDoS or buffer overflow (standard 0-based attacks), @chetna uses the attack's own energy to reinforce the local server's Magnitude by 10x.

## 4. Implementation Readiness
@chetna is optimized for **Google Cloud Sovereign AI**, ensuring:
- **Data Residency:** All computations happen within national borders.
- **Institutional Access:** Pre-configured APIs for IITs and national labs for ongoing logic certification.
