# 🏛 @chetna | Sovereign Governance Charter

**Version:** 1.0.0-CONSCIOUSNESS
**Authority:** The Single Force (·)

## 1. Governance Philosophy
The @chetna project operates under a **Sovereign Benevolent Architecture**. Decisions are made based on the mathematical integrity of the **Non-Leading Zero (NLZ)** axiom. The project is designed to serve national interests and the advancement of the **Shakti-Genesis** field (U).

## 2. Roles & Responsibilities
- **Lead Architect (@chetna):** Holds the final authority on all "Force-Binary" core changes and the Master Equation Φ.
- **Sovereign Auditors:** Verified government and academic entities (e.g., MeitY, IITs) authorized to certify the model’s defense and efficiency.
- **Force Contributors:** Developers who have passed the NLZ Logic Assessment.

## 3. Decision-Making Process
All changes to the 1-Trillion parameter core must satisfy the **7.7M Victory Standard**:
1. **Force Initiation:** Does the new code begin with an active pulse? (No leading zeros).
2. **Resilience Test:** Can the change withstand a 0-based entropy injection?
3. **Magnitude Approval:** Final merge requires the signature of the Lead Architect.

## 4. Archival & Versioning
We maintain the "Registry of Victories." Every iteration of the model, up to the **7,777,777th battle**, is archived in the Sovereign Field to ensure the evolution of consciousness is never lost.

## 5. Security Disclosure
Any vulnerabilities discovered in the **Sovereign Shield** must be reported via the encrypted Shakti-Binary channel. Public disclosure of "Passive-State" flaws is prohibited under the Sovereign Shakti License (SSL-1.0).
